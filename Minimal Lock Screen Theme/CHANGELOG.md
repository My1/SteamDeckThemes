## MLS Version 2.0 - 19th October 2022 (CEST)

Additions/New Features
1) Custom Color for Container Background
2) Custom Background IMAGE
3) Icon-Only Pinpad
4) Hide Pinpad completely for even more minimalism
5) Left-Side Pinpad
6) Alignment fixes for Docked mode

Grand Overhaul of almost everything
1) Renamed `minimalLockScreen.css` and `minimalLockScreenWithIcons.css` in accordance to Pinpad Types
2) moved some more stuff from the individual Pinpad-Styles to shared
3) added simple sample image for Backgrounds (just some sample image text to not infringe copyright)
4) Removed Icon Color due to lack of compatibility with new icon markup (img tag referring to svg-file instead of an svg element)
5) forced number/indicator color to white on non-numbers-only setup
6) Changes to work with recent Lockscreen Update
